# IoMBian Installed Services Downloader

This service handles the firebase service installed services and updates the local iombian services accordingly.

`installed_services` is a collection on each device that determines what services are installed on a device.
Each document in the collection is a service, and its structure is this:
```
{
    version: "0.1.0",
    env: {
        LOG_LEVEL: "INFO",
        BUTTON_EVENTS_PORT: 5556,
        ...
    }
}
```

When a service is added, removed or modified in the installed services, the local services are updated unless the service structure is not correct.

## Docker

After building the image, execute it with docker run:

```
docker run --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} --rm -d -v /opt/iombian-services:/opt/iombian-services -e BASE_PATH=/opt/iombian-services iombian-installed-services-downloader:latest
